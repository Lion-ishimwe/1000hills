        In the northwestern corner of Rwanda, Volcanoes National Park rises into the clouds, home to misty peaks and the famous mountain gorillas. This is where conservation legend Dian Fossey conducted her research—and where you can walk in her footsteps.

        <h2>Why Visit Volcanoes?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gorilla trekking: meet the legendary mountain gorillas</li>
            <li>Golden monkey tracking in bamboo forests</li>
            <li>Volcano hikes to dramatic craters</li>
            <li>Cultural encounters with local communities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The main draw? Gorilla trekking, hands down. Meeting a silverback face-to-face is a life-altering moment. But Volcanoes has more to offer: golden monkeys swing through the bamboo forests, volcano hikes lead to dramatic craters, and local communities offer rich cultural encounters.

        <blockquote>
         “From the haunting cries of primates to the lush, cinematic scenery, Volcanoes National Park feels otherworldly.”

          It’s more than a destination—it’s a journey into the heart of Africa’s primal beauty.
