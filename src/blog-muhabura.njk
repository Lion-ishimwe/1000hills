            Standing proud in Rwanda’s northern highlands, Mount Bisoke is a dormant volcano that dares trekkers to climb. Part of the Virunga range, it straddles the Rwanda DRC border and at 3,711 meters, it’s a vigorous yet rewarding day ascent. The trail threads through bamboo and montane forest before delivering a show stopping finale: a glassy crater lake on the summit rim with sweeping views across the volcano studded landscape.</p>
        <h2>Why Climb Bisoke?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Iconic summit crater lake (400m across) a photogenic payoff at the top.</li>
            <li>Lush montane & bamboo forest gorilla country, near Dian Fossey’s historic Karisoke site.</li>
            <li>Panoramic views across the Virunga range and into the DRC on clear days.</li>
            <li>A rewarding, ranger-guided day hike from Kinigi (1,000m ascent to 3,711m).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unlike many summit hikes, Bisoke delivers a big payoff fast: the trail winds through lush bamboo and Hagenia Hypericum montane forest true gorilla country before cresting at a perfectly round crater lake about 400m across. From the rim you get sweeping views along the Virunga range and into the DRC, all in a ranger guided day hike that starts with a morning briefing at Kinigi. You’ll also be walking in the shadow of conservation history: Dian Fossey founded the Karisoke Research Center right between Bisoke and Karisimbi.</p>

            Bisoke is for adventurers at heart. Those who climb it don’t just reach a crater rim they rediscover their own limits.</p>
