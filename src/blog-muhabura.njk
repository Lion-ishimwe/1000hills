            Standing tall on Rwanda’s northern frontier, Mount Muhabura is a dormant volcano that dares the bold to climb. Part of the Virunga range, Muhabura is shared between Rwanda and Uganda—and at 4,127 meters, it’s a challenging but rewarding ascent.

        <h2>Why Climb Muhabura?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scenic alpine vegetation and ancient lava fields</li>
            <li>Uncrowded trails for true adventurers</li>
            <li>Sweeping summit views over Rwanda, Uganda, and the DRC</li>
            <li>Spot the twin lakes on clear days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unlike its more famous neighbor, Muhabura remains relatively uncrowded. The climb takes you through scenic alpine vegetation, past ancient lava fields and moss-covered trees. At the summit, you’re rewarded with sweeping views over Rwanda, Uganda, and the DRC—and on a clear day, you might even spot the twin lakes below.

            “There’s no lodge or luxury here—just you, the trail, and the mountain.”

        <p>
            Muhabura is for adventurers at heart. Those who climb it don’t just reach the top—they rediscover their own limits.
