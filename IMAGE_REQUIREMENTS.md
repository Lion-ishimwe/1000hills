# Image Requirements for Services Showcase

Your new services showcase layout requires the following images to be placed in the `src/images/` directory:

## Required Images:

1. **`transport-service.jpg`** - Professional transportation service image
   - Should show modern vehicles, professional drivers, or transportation infrastructure
   - Recommended size: 800x600px or larger
   - Should represent your transportation services professionally

2. **`cultural-tour.jpg`** - Cultural heritage and tourism image
   - Should show traditional Rwandan culture, local artisans, or cultural sites
   - Recommended size: 800x600px or larger
   - Should represent authentic cultural experiences

## Current Images Used:
- âœ… `gorilla.jpg` - Already exists and is being used for gorilla trekking services

## Image Guidelines:
- Use high-quality, professional images
- Ensure images are properly licensed for commercial use
- Optimize images for web (compress to reasonable file sizes)
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios for visual harmony
- Images should represent the authentic experience of your services

## Alternative Options:
If you don't have specific images yet, you can:
1. Use stock photos from services like Unsplash, Pexels, or Shutterstock
2. Take your own photos during tours and services
3. Use placeholder images temporarily while you gather the real ones

The layout will automatically adjust to accommodate different image sizes and orientations.
